# Golang Architecture Standards

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns. Inner layers (Domain) rely on nothing. Outer layers (Adapters) rely on Inner.
- **Project Layout**: Follow standard Go project layout (`cmd`, `internal`, `pkg`).
- **Dependency Injection**: Explicitly pass dependencies via constructors. Avoid global singletons.
- **Package Oriented Design**: Organize by feature/domain, not by layer (avoid `controllers/`, `services/` at root).
- **Interface Segregation**: Define interfaces where they are _used_ (Consumer implementation).

## Standard Project Layout

See [Standard Project Layout](references/project-layout.md) for directory tree.

### Layer Rules

- **Domain**: Inner-most. No deps.
- **UseCase**: Depends on Domain.
- **Adapter**: Outer-most. Depends on UseCase/Domain.

## Guidelines

- **Use Constructors**: `NewService(repo Repository) *Service`.
- **Inversion of Control**: Service depends on `Repository` interface, not `SQLRepository` struct.
- **Wire up in Main**: Main function composes the dependency graph.

## Verification Checklist (Mandatory)

- [ ] **No Globals**: Are there any global singletons or package-level variables being mutated?
- [ ] **DI**: Are dependencies explicitly passed via constructors?
- [ ] **Interfaces**: Are interfaces defined at the consumer side (where they are used)?
- [ ] **Layering**: Does `internal/domain` have zero external dependencies?
- [ ] **Composition**: Are dependencies wired together in `main.go`?
