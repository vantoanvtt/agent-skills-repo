# Security

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Principles

- **XSS Prevention**: Angular sanitizes by default. Do NOT use `innerHTML` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Bypass Security**: Avoid `DomSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrust...` unless the content source is trusted.
- **Route Guards**: Protect all sensitive routes with `CanActivateFn`.

## Guidelines

- **CSP**: Configure Content Security Policy headers on the server.
- **HTTP**: Use Interceptors to attach secure tokens (HttpOnly cookies preferred over LocalStorage tokens).
- **Secrets**: NEVER store secrets (API keys) in Angular code.
