# React Native Notifications

## **Priority: P1 (OPERATIONAL)**

Push notifications using React Native Firebase or Expo Notifications.

## Guidelines

- **Library**: Choose `@react-native-firebase/messaging` (Bare) or `expo-notifications` (Managed).
- **Setup**: Configure Platform channels (Android) and APNs (iOS).
- **Lifecycle**: Handle Foreground (`onMessage`), Background (`onNotificationOpenedApp`), and Quit (`getInitialNotification`) states.
- **Permissions**: Prime users before requesting system authorization.

[Implementation Details](references/implementation.md)

## Anti-Patterns

- **No Unconditional Requests**: Spamming permission dialogs leads to high denial rates.
- **No Missing Handlers**: Forgetting "Quit" state handling results in lost deep links.
- **No Unvalidated Data**: Blindly trusting payload data causes runtime crashes.
